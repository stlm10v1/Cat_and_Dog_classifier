# 🐱🐶 Image Classification using CNN & Traditional ML

This project performs **binary image classification** on a dataset containing images of **cats and dogs**. The primary goal is to build and compare image classifiers using both:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Traditional ML models (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM)** with **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** features.

---

## 📍 Project Highlights

- Developed as an assignment under the course **ME698G: Deep Learning in Mechanical Sciences** at **IIT Kanpur**.
- Built a **CNN-based model** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Built traditional ML pipelines using HOG features + KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
- Compared performance metrics to identify the best model.
- Deployed the final CNN model as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.
